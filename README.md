*This application was done in the context of a group Programming Language Concepts coursework 
alongside 2 other students. It is being published here for the purpose of logging all projects 
I have worked on, but I am not the sole owner or writer of this code.*

*This coursework was about writing a language interpreter in Haskell, using Happy and Yacc. The language had to accomplish
a set of initial tasks, but also be flexible enough to then accomplish tasks we were not yet made aware of.*

*Definitely not my finest work, but something I'm glad I did and learned about.*
